####I decided to follow some of the tutorials from [https://medium.com/@_expr/the-pursuit-of-hapi-ness-d82777afaa4b]

>I have altered the code somewhat, but the files have explicit names
>and the final code with no comments is in the index.js file.
>All other files contain extensive comments!

Here we will:

1. Create a simple server
2. Simple or Hardcoded Routing
3. Routing with a path name
4. Validating with Joi
5. Caching

>I have also added another simple API tutorial from [http://blog.modulus.io/nodejs-and-hapi-create-rest-api]


So be _Hapi_!
